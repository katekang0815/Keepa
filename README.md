Keepa 👋

A mobile prayer companion designed to help children and teens build a daily habit of reflection and prayer through emotional awareness and guided conversation.

📖 Overview

Keepa is a mobile application built with Expo and React Native that helps young users develop a consistent prayer habit by beginning with emotional check-ins.

Instead of starting with “What should I pray?”, Keepa starts with:

“How are you feeling today?”

Users reflect on their emotional state, explore relevant scripture, and generate guided prayers tailored to how they feel.

The goal is to create a safe, structured, and supportive environment where children and teens can process emotions through faith-based reflection.

Keepa combines:

Daily emotional awareness

Guided spiritual reflection

AI-assisted prayer conversations

Longitudinal emotional tracking

⚠️ Disclaimer
Keepa is not a replacement for pastoral care, therapy, or mental health support. It is a structured spiritual journaling companion designed to encourage healthy reflection habits.
