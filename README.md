# Keepa 👋

A mobile prayer companion designed to help children and teens build a daily habit of reflection and prayer through emotional awareness and guided conversation.

📌 **Overview

Keeper is a mobile application built with Expo and React Native that helps users develop a consistent prayer habit by starting with emotional check-ins. The app encourages children and teens to reflect on how they feel, explore related scripture, and generate guided prayers tailored to their current emotional state.

The goal is to create a safe, structured, and supportive environment where young users can process emotions through faith-based reflection.

The app combines:
- Daily emotional awareness
- Guided spiritual reflection
- AI-assisted prayer conversations
- Longitudinal emotional tracking

Keeper is not a replacement for pastoral care or mental health support. It is a structured spiritual journaling companion designed to support healthy habits.
